# DW Movie Trailers

This web page displays a list of my favorite movies with their poster images and movie trailers.<br>
This project, the first in [Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd004), focuses on writing server-side code to store a list of movies (in a Python class object).

<i>You can check out the demo at [here](http://dawoonc.github.io/dw-movie-trailers).</i>

## How to use

Inside the project directory, run the movies.py file. This file will execute all necessary codes and creates (or overwrites) a index.html file. The index.html file will be automatically opened in your web browser.
